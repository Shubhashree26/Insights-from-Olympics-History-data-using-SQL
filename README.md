# Insights-from-Olympics-History-data-using-SQL
**This Project discovers how the Olympics have evolved over time, including insights about the participation and performance of men and women athletes , different nations, and different sports and events.**

## Understanding the Dataset:
This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. 
I picked this dataset from Kaggle which consists of two distinct tables, athlete events, and event regions.

[Check out 120 years of Olympic History Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns.
Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events).
The file noc_regions.csv contains NOCs (National Olympic Committees) information and the country it belongs to.

## Tools and Database Used:
- Postgre SQL
- pgAdmin 4

I have found some important and useful insights from the Olympic history dataset by writing the optimized SQL queries in PostgreSQL RDBMS.
I wrote 20 SQL Queries using this data. For each of these queries, you would find the problem statement in the questions pdf file.

## Key Findings:
1. Top 5 most successful countries in terms of total medals won in the Olympics are the USA, Russia, Germany, UK, and France.
2. Ratio of male and female athletes who participated in all Olympics games is 2.64
3. France, UK, Italy, and Switzerland are the only countries those participated in all of the 51 Olympics games conducted till now.
4. Udham Singh Kular and Leslie Walter Claudius are the 2 athletes from India who won the most gold medals for India in the Olympics. (Game - Hockey)
