# Insights-from-Olympics-History-data-using-SQL
**This Project discovers how the Olympics have evolved over time, including insights about the participation and performance of men and women athletes , different nations, and different sports and events.**

## Understanding the Dataset:
This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. 
I picked this dataset from Kaggle which consists of two distinct tables, athlete events, and event regions.

[Check out 120 years of Olympic History Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns.
Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events).
The file noc_regions.csv contains NOCs (National Olympic Committees) information and the country it belongs to.

## Tools and Database Used:
- Postgre SQL
- pgAdmin 4

I have found out some important and useful insights from the Olympic history dataset by writing the optimised SQL queries in PostgreSQL RDBMS.
I wrote 20 SQL Queries using this data. For each of these queries, you would find the problem statement in questions pdf file.
